## Scenario 2: Customer Asks "How Do I...?" Question

### Customer's Ticket:

**Subject:** Question about automating monthly reports

**From:** James Chen, Finance Analyst at TechStart Inc.

**Message:**
> Hello,
>
> I've been manually running the same report every month and exporting it to Excel, then doing some calculations and formatting before sending it to my manager. It's taking me about 2 hours each month.
>
> Someone mentioned that I might be able to use Python to automate this process, but I'm not really a programmer. Is this something your software supports? Can you help me set this up? I'd like to have it automatically email the formatted report to my manager on the first Monday of each month.
>
> Let me know what's possible.
>
> Thanks,
> James

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with empathy** - Acknowledge the customer's situation before diving into technical details
2. **Ask before assuming** - If you're not sure what they mean, ask clarifying questions
3. **Be honest about limitations** - It's okay to say "I need to investigate this" or "I'll need to check with our team"
4. **Provide value immediately** - Even if you can't solve it right away, offer something helpful (documentation, workaround, timeline)
5. **Use clear structure** - Break your response into logical sections (acknowledgment, questions, next steps, etc.)
6. **Avoid jargon** - Explain technical concepts in plain language when possible
7. **End with clear next steps** - Make it obvious what will happen next and what the customer should do (if anything)

Good luck!
